#Gitifications

The native app to get notifications when you have github notifications. Written in NodeJS and powered by Electron, Gitifications checks for your github notifications and sends your system a popup notification when you receive a Github notification.

### Install for Mac

    git clone https://github.com/onetwopunch/gitifications
    ./bin/build

Then copy the `Gitifcations.app` file from `dist/Gitifcations-darwin-x86` to your Applications folder. You can then click on it from within your launcher to start it up :)

### Development

    npm install
    npm start


Contributions always needed. If you want to run a development console:

    ./bin/console
